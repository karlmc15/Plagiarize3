<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">In the
present chapter, we shall try and clarify the processes of conceptualization,
i.e. how we develop abstract ideas from the data of experience. Many
philosophers have previously attempted this difficult task, but have strayed
into error or irrelevancy due to their failure to grasp all the logical issues
involved. We need to explain how comparisons and contrasts are effected, without
engaging in circular reasoning. We need to show that logical tests are not
arbitrary standards, as some accuse, but constitute the only honest and sane way
to assess any data input. We need to clarify verbalization, and ensure that it
does not skew our ideas. We may also try and propose a theory of
‘universals.’</span></p>
<h2><a name="1. Sameness and Difference"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bookmark: _Toc16390259">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">
</span>Sameness and Difference</span></a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Alleged
apprehensions of sameness and difference are the primordial basis of all
concept-formation, that is of grouping and naming or classification. These are
of two kinds, <i>particular</i> sameness or difference, which relate to purely
perceptual (material or mental) or intuitive (self-known) items; and later <i>abstract</i>
sameness or difference, which relate to conceptual products of the former. Or we
could say more precisely, sameness and difference on a particular level are the
foundations of abstraction, i.e. whatever we judge same to each other and
different from other things become thereby members of the <i>first</i>
abstracts, all others being ultimately <i>derived</i> from them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">An important insight or
principle we may suggest at the outset is that <b>similarity is not something we
apprehend – it is <i>dis</i>similarity we apprehend; similarity is just the
absence of dissimilarity</b>. Thus, despite the polarities we have given the
words, similarity is something negative, whereas dissimilarity is something
positive. Everything seems the same to us, till we discern some difference. We
judge things singular or same, if we have noticed no plurality or difference
between them. Thus, strictly speaking, dissimilarity can be experienced, whereas
similarity is a rational object.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Let us first
consider certain percepts (material or mental objects of perception) in the
visual field (specifically, shapes), and then we shall turn to other visual
percepts, as well as auditory percepts and those in other sense-modalities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">When faced
with two visible <i>material</i> percepts (phenomena appearing <i>at the same
time</i> in the visual field), we ‘compare’ them mainly by mentally
projecting (externally imagining) parallel lines from points on the one to
points on the other (the points being imagined subdivisions of the phenomena,
into light or dark dots – digital 1s and 0s). If all such lines pair-off dots
which are both alight or both dark, the objects are judged to be completely
similar (identical); if no dots thus correspond, the objects are judged
completely different, if only some correspond, the objects are judged in some
respects <i>same</i> (similar) and in other respects <i>different</i>
(dissimilar). There are thus <i>degrees</i> of sameness or difference.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Such <b><span style="color:navy">comparison</span></b>
(in its widest sense, including both comparison with the positive aim of finding
points of similarity and that with the negative aim of finding points of
dissimilarity, i.e. ‘contrast’) thus involves an imaginative act
(specifically, a hallucination of mental lines into the material region of
space), but its result is given by the visual phenomenon (there evidently are or
are not pairs of light or dark dots at the two ends of the lines).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Another, less
direct way we compare visual material objects is by externally projecting a
mental image of one object (usually one perceived previously, whose image is
thus stored in memory) onto the other material object (currently present in the
visual field). Such <i>juxtaposition</i> primarily occurs when the two material
objects are not simultaneously present, or so far apart in space that focusing
on one turns one’s attention away from the other so that they cannot strictly
be regarded as sharing the same visual field at the same time. In such case, we

Here again, an imaginative act is involved (projection into external space of a
mental image or memory), but the judgment is based on passive observations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">A third,
still less direct way is to compare and contrast mental images of both the
material objects under scrutiny – this may be used for instance if neither
object is present long enough, both being too ephemeral. Other ways are
experimental: the observer may seemingly move himself relative to the two
objects so that they are in the same line of vision (appeal to perspective) or
seemingly move one object so that it is physically on top of the other and
blanks it out in every direction</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">.
Such physical experiments do not per se involve mental projections.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">In practice,
all these various ways might be used in combinations, reinforcing each other or
mitigating our judgments somewhat (as to the degree of similarity and
dissimilarity). Physical experiments may be criticized as actually changing the
visual field, in that what is compared after said movement is not the original
scene, but a new scene – in which case, we have to in fact appeal to a memory
(i.e. a mental image) of the object moved, juxtaposed on its alleged new
manifestation, and judge the two as the same by an inference (image 1 is like
object 1 and like/unlike object 2, therefore objects 1 &amp; 2 are like/unlike).
Therefore, even such experimental comparisons involve imagination.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">In addition
to comparisons of shape, we must consider comparisons of size – that is, the <i>measures<b>
</b></i>or<b><i> </i></b><i>degrees<b> </b></i>of things. Two things may have
the same shape, but different sizes. To deal with this problem, we introduce the
concept of <i>proportion</i>. Comparative measurement is an experimental act in
that, in imagination or physically, we bring to bear a standard of measurement,
a graduated measuring rod. In visual imagination this simply means that, instead
of comparing dots (as above), we compare collections of dots – dashes (lines
of two or more points), while ignoring or making note of the differences in
their numbers of constituent dots (according as we are satisfied with imprecise
proportions or need to be exact).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Considerations
of ‘scale’ often involve a mental act of ‘zooming in.’ In <i>Buddhist
Illogic</i></span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">,
I state:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:35.4pt;text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:navy">Now,
the zooming in is merely production of a new image – so we are not even, in
fact, repeatedly subdividing the same image; we merely <i>say</i> ‘suppose
this image is a detail of the preceding’. The new image has the same size as
the preceding, but its <i>scale</i> is declared different.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">It is worth
stressing here that this declaration need not be verbal, and is more precisely <i>an
intention</i>. That is, we intend some visualized line to be considered as <i>a
portion </i>of another visualized line, even though both lines are in fact
(about) the <i>same</i> size when projected in our heads. Neither the mental
projection of images, nor a verbal declaration, can fully explain
‘proportion’ – we additionally must, note well, refer to the <i>intuited</i>
intention that this line ‘represents’ a fraction of that line. Thereafter,
we can specify how many such fractions would equal the whole.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The mental
drawing of lines first mentioned may also be criticized as taking time and
involving shifts of attention, so that by the time the lines are drawn it is no
longer the original two objects that we are comparing but our many mental images
(memories) of them. However, these various images have each in succession passed
the test of correspondence with their original objects (image 1 matches object
1, image 2 matches object 2) – we express this fact by calling them ‘<i>representative</i>’
– so that we may justly infer the resulting judgment (that objects 1 &amp; 2
are the same/different) from the equality or inequality of their images. In
conclusion, the comparison and contrast of material objects may well generally
involve mental projection of images of their objects, though many rely mainly on
projection of lines between objects too.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">It should be
mentioned that visual experiences do not only involve shapes, but also
light-intensity (shadings) and frequency (colors<i>)</i>. How for instance do we
recognize various colors as all green, say, although they range noticeably? For
such qualities, an argument by analogy seems called for. It is also by analogy
that we must here try to explain comparisons with respect to the experiential
fields of <i>the other sense-modalities</i>, sounds, smells, tastes and touch
phenomena. Presumably, we mentally cut up the experiences into elementary
phenomena, which we then compare to each other or to imaginary substitutes, or
experimentally determine in some way (e.g. at later stages in development, we
could record sounds into a computer and have it project on its screen visible
waves which mathematically correspond to the sound waves concerned).</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[4]</span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Whereas
material phenomena of light or sound have obvious mental equivalents – we can
think visual images (including colors) or speak to oneself (i.e. in one’s
head) at will – it is not immediately evident that we can produce mental
images (memories) of smell, taste and touch phenomena at will while awake
(though my own introspections suggest they do occur in dreams while asleep). Be
that as it may, unless we can think up some fitting alternative theoretical
scenario, we have to assume the doctrine that imagination (or at least memory)
of these sense-modalities is possible, since we evidently are able to <i>recognize</i>
such phenomena!</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[5]</span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">We should
also consider comparison of <i>mental</i> objects of perception. With regard to
the visual field, first, internal or external imagination of lines, joined at
will from point to point of any two objects, would be a sufficient hypothesis.
There is no logical need, here, to produce a mental image of either mental
image, since just as soon as the primary mental objects are thought of (with a
view to compare them) they are present in the mental visual field and such
imagination would be redundant. But one can, rather than mentally draw lines
between them, mentally move one mental object over to the other, juxtaposing
them for point-by-point confirmation of similarity or difference. Such moving
seemingly does not require further confirmation by images, since it is as it
were guaranteed by the observer’s introspected will. Similarly supposedly for
the other sense-modalities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Comparisons
and contrasts between intuited particulars, on the basis of which abstracts
concerning the psyche are assumed, are more difficult to trace. They evidently
occur introspectively somehow, but I cannot at this stage suggest just how, so I
will leave the issue wide open.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The
above-mentioned first abstracts are only among the most basic. From their
application a whole world of more specific or generic abstracts is gradually
inferred, adduced or assumed. For example, there are also, we assume by analogy
from phenomenal and intuitive feelings, ‘abstract feelings’ inferred from the
value judgments and behavior patterns of the observer. These are not to be
confused with pleasure/pain</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[6]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">
sentiments (which are physiological phenomena, i.e. concrete material phenomena
experienced within the body), which may occasionally be caused (we believe) by
abstract feelings. Nor should we confuse these with what I have earlier named
‘mental feelings’ (if any such exist) and ‘intuitive feelings’ (which
are raw data for abstraction). Abstract feelings are hypothetical entities,
stretching terms by analogy; they are more judgmental, or rational in nature.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">With regard
to cognition of more abstract sameness or difference, then, we should in
principle regard our identifications as <i>hypotheses subject to the laws of
adduction</i>. The concepts of concrete sameness and difference are by analogy
extended to include presumed/alleged/postulated abstract sameness and
difference. We do not directly ‘see’ abstracts as same or different, as we
do concretes. Rather, we postulate that something akin to sameness or difference
relates two given abstracts (respectively inferred as above described), and then
test this theory by adductively confirming or rejecting it, in competition with
conceivable alternatives. The process of comparison is here less direct, and
less permanently sure in its results.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">In practice,
the objects we compare are rarely simple visual shapes, but complexes with many
aspects. All the above-described concrete processes, and additionally many
abstract ones, will be called upon in tandem for any given act of comparison. So
it is difficult to describe comparison in a succinct manner. For instance, let
us compare two carpets on my living room floor. I can basically relate them in
respect of their rectangularity by drawing lines from the corners of the one to
those of the other. This is possible even if they are different in size or
differently placed, by calling on perspective adjustments. But if one were round
and the other square, this would be inconclusive, and I would have to refer to
their color or texture (a touch phenomenon), or more abstractly to their fabric
(wool or cotton) or even their function (warmth, decoration, etc.). Or comparing
two trees, I would not expect their overall shape to be always similar, but
would refer instead to bark and leaves, or cells viewed under a microscope, or
more abstractly to observed biological processes (themselves complex).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">In
conclusion, sameness or difference are geometrical judgments at the simplest
concrete level of visible shape, but at more complex levels, other
sense-modalities as well as abstract hypotheses and inferences (themselves
somewhat based on previous concrete experiences) are generally taken into
consideration in determining sameness and difference</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[7]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">.
Nevertheless, I have attempted here to postulate a scenario, which would
credibly explain how we apprehend sameness or difference, already to some
extent, at the simplest concrete level. I personally see no alternative
explanation yet, and so regard it as a good working hypothesis, justifying our
comparisons (to the extent that we have been attentive enough, of course). It is
acknowledged, however, that even apparently simple cases are usually far more
complex in fact, and it is difficult to describe such processes precisely, as
they vary tremendously (involving many sense-modalities, and conceptual/logical
work too).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Direct or
indirect comparison/contrast may be considered as principles of logic, insofar
as it is on their basis that we begin conceptualization. Once percepts of any
kind are thus declared same or different in certain or all respects, we mentally
<i>group</i> their images in our minds (probably more precisely, link their
memories in the networks of our brains) and, usually but not always, <i>label</i>
them with a name (i.e. a physical or imaginary sound – and in the case of
written language, a visual symbol). The value or utility of naming is that it
provides us with an easily invoked substitute for experiences difficult to bring
to mind (like smells, tastes or touch phenomena) or more abstract concepts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:35.4pt;text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">It
must be emphasized that the mystery of sameness and difference cannot (as some
philosophers have tried) be explained-away by just saying that the arbitrary
names we give to things are their only common grounds. Logically, this
hypothesis begs the question, in that names <i>too</i> have individual
instances, which must be judged same or different!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The prime
concepts resulting from such grouping and naming (effectively these are
propositions, like ‘x is same to y, therefore both shall be symbolized by
z’) may then serve as objects in eventual derivative ‘abstract’
comparisons, which in turn may yield more abstract ones still, as classification
progresses higher or deeper. It should be clear, at least if the above
explanations are naturally convincing, that the role of imagination in
comparison processes does not detract from the <i>objectivity</i> of the
sameness or difference concluded. The mental projections involved do not affect
the material objects they try to represent (and are shown to do so by matching)
– they are not ‘mind over matter’ type volitions, arbitrary manipulations
– they are merely juxtaposed. For this reason, we can fairly regard our prime
concepts (and their eventual derivatives by inductive logic) as
‘empirically’ based and epistemologically justified.</span></p>

</span>Compatibility or Incompatibility</span></a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Allied to
sameness and difference are the concepts of compatibility or incompatibility,
which underlie what Aristotle has called the three ‘laws of thought’ –
identity, non-contradiction and exclusion-of-the-middle. How do we apprehend
things (percepts, intuitions, concepts and propositions about them) as able to
coexist (compatible) or as unable to do so (incompatible) or problematic (not
established as either compatible or incompatible)? We must answer this question
urgently, if we admit that these logical processes of <b><span style="color:navy">confrontation</span></b>
(or facing-off) are as basic as those of identifying sameness or difference. The
whole of logical science is built on their assumption, and we must explain how
we know two things to be harmonious or mutually exclusive or of undecided
correlation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">An important
insight or principle we may suggest at the outset is that <b>consistency is not
something we apprehend – it is <i>in</i>consistency we apprehend; consistency
is just the absence of inconsistency</b>. Thus, despite the polarities we have
given the words, compatibility is something negative, whereas incompatibility is
something positive. Everything seems harmonious to us, till we discern some
conflict. We judge things consistent, so long as we have no logical insight of
inconsistency between them. Thus, strictly speaking, inconsistency can be
directly ‘seen’, whereas consistency is normally assumed till found lacking.
In some cases, consistency is indirectly put in doubt, without some direct
inconsistency having been found, so that an uncertainty arises.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Aristotle
formulated his three ‘laws’ firstly with reference to percepts or concepts
by stating them as ‘A is A’, ‘A cannot be non-A’ and ‘Either A or
non-A’. In a later stage, they are formulated with reference to propositions.

but have to be regarded as given in their objects somehow. Psychologically, they
are profound impulses (which may be ignored or followed), which make humans
rational; ethically (in the ethics of knowledge gathering), they are
indispensable tools and imperatives to actively respond to certain epistemic
situations in certain ways (though one can be dishonest or unaware and ignore
the facts, or evasive or lazy and ignore the imperative).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Identity
brings to mind the visual image and sensation of calm or attraction or a
tendency to merge of two things (equation), contradiction that of conflict or
repulsion or explosive collision between them (because they cannot occupy the
same place), while exclusion of the middle refers to a gap or deficiency between
them (raising doubts and awakening questions). These may be imaginative
representations for philosophical discussion like here, but they are not always
(if ever) involved in concrete identification of identity, contradiction or
research needs. Their involvement is more technical or abstract, straddling as
it were the experiential domain and the conceptual knowledge domain. Although
formulated as a triad, the laws of thought are three aspects of essentially one
and the same necessity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The law of
identity, simply put, tells us “what you see is what you get” – it is a
mere acknowledgment that the data of phenomenal experience are the fundamental
givens of any knowledge enterprise; that there is ultimately no other data to
base inference on, so that all their details must be paid attention to and taken
into consideration in any inference. With respect to its formulation as ‘A is
A’, with reference to terms rather than propositions, this law would simply
mean that, if we for instance compare the constituent points in any two material
or mental complex phenomena, we have to acknowledge that wherever dots <i>appear</i>
(or fail to appear) to us, we can definitively say that there <i>are</i> (or are
not, respectively) dots (at least phenomenal dots) – at least for now, until
if ever the situation changes or further scrutiny tends to belie the first
observation (because many later observations supplant the first, by their
statistical weight).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Identity is a
law, because there is no other way to conceive things – <i>at this phenomenal
level to ‘seem’ is to ‘be’</i>. You can deny your phenomenon’s
reality, but not its very occurrence or existence. If you try to deny your
actual phenomenon by <i>immediately</i> hypothesizing some invisible conflicting
‘phenomenon’ behind it (a noumenon, to use Kant’s word), you are condemned
to being basically unempirical and therefore without epistemological
justification for your own act. You have nothing to show for your case, since by
definition you appeal to the <i>un</i>seen, <i>whereas you must acknowledge the
seen as seen to at all deny it</i>. The baselessness and circularity of such
refusal to accept the phenomenon (<i>as</i> a phenomenon, no more, at least)
merely reflects that the phenomenon experienced is the given to deal with in the
first place (for this reason any denial of it is bound to admit it, implicitly
and explicitly by referring to it). All such argumentation is of course very
conceptual, and so only at best lately and peripherally significant in any
actual act of acceptance of the phenomenon as such.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Phenomenologically,
the law of identity means that an image of a material entity, mentally projected
externally onto that entity, does not blank out the entity (being as it were in
a parallel space, transparent). When such mental image seemingly shares outer
space with the material body it is projected on, then the phenomenon as a whole
has changed, though the material entity stays on (perseveres as an appearance),
having been <i>augmented</i> in respect of a mental image. That is, the new
phenomenon is enlarged (by an additional image) in comparison to the originally
given phenomenon. This means that postulation of a noumenon merely adds a mental
component (including additional phenomena) to the first presented phenomenon,
and does not succeed in erasing the first phenomenon, precisely because it is
introduced <i>in relation to</i> the first phenomenon (specifically, as an
attempt to explain it or explain it away).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The law of
identity is an impulse, a call to empiricism, which we normally obey without
doubt or question. It acknowledges that appearances might in the long run change
or prove misleading, taking into consideration all other appearances. It does
not deny, nor accept <i>ab initio</i>, that behind the seen appearance there
might be unseen or invisible events or things; but such outcome can only be
arrived at through an overall consideration of all experiences and much
pondering. That is, ‘noumena’ might well exist beyond a given field of
phenomena – but they would have to be end products of an evaluative process
and could not be first assumptions. Since evoking noumena does not in itself
annul phenomena (merely adding more phenomena to them), the questions inherent
in phenomena and their apparition to us remain unanswered.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:35.4pt;text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The
reason why the thesis of noumena seems at first sight credible, is that we have
experience of different sense-modalities, each implying that the others are <i>incomplete</i>,
and we have memory of changes in our experience and/or its interpretation <i>over
time</i>, so that our conceptual knowledge (or its suppositions) has naturally
come to conclusions that ‘<i>things are not quite or always what they seem</i>’.
But in such case, the term noumenon is trivially but another name for abstracts
or concepts. In Kant’s coinage and use of the term, however, the noumenon is
not a hidden extension of the phenomenon, but purports to discard and replace
the phenomenon altogether. The noumenon is by definition unknowable
(universally) – though Kantians never tell us how come <i>they</i> themselves
have the privilege to even know enough <i>about</i> it to know that it exists
and is unknowable! The correct statement would rather be that noumena (i.e. less
abstrusely, abstracts, concepts) are not concrete experiences, but merely
logically assumed derivatives of percepts. They are hoped to be ontologically
‘more real’ than percepts, digging deeper into reality than the visible
surface of things (to which we are supposedly restricted somewhat by the limited
range of sense-modalities open to cognition), even as they are epistemologically
admitted to be less reliable.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The laws of
non-contradiction and of the excluded middle are intertwined with that of
identity, as evident in the arguments above. But how do we know that ‘A is not
non-A’ or that it is either-or between them? Consider our basic dot of light
or its absence (darkness) in the visual field – such a dot is evidently never
in contradiction with itself. We never simultaneously perceive a dot and
not-perceive it – in any given place we mentally chose to focus on, there
either appears or does not appear a lighted (or dark) dot. At this level, where
the object is reduced to a single character (light) and precise place (the
smallest possible size), we cannot <i>honestly, sincerely</i> answer ‘yes and
no’ or ‘neither yes nor no’ to the question. It is there or it is not. If
it seems there, it is. If it does not seem there, it is not. We cannot even
pretend we don’t see what we see – at least not in words, for we would have
to acknowledge their meanings, and therefore the actual phenomenon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">These laws
are indeed <i>in</i> the phenomenal world, insofar as positively no phenomena
ever appear in contradiction or as neither-nor, i.e. by <i>absence</i> of
empirical evidence to the contrary. They are in, because their negations are <i>not</i>
in. But they relate to mind, inasmuch as when a dot A appears and we start
speaking of the unseen non-A, <i>we are in fact imagining non-A in our heads</i>,
and so bring a new (mental) element into the picture. By the law of identity,
this non-A phenomenon (which is mental) must be distinguished from its alleged
opposite A (the given, which may or may not be mental), and admitted as an <i>addition</i>
in the experiential field. But it remains true that A and non-A themselves are
not in fact coexisting or both absent in the field – rather what we experience
is coexistence of the given A with a <i>projected</i> non-A.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The law of
contradiction does not deny the possibility that two <i>different</i> things
might coexist, like a dot of light and the imagination (or memory) of absence of
such dot of light; such things are merely contrary. The law of the excluded
middle does not deny the possibility for something and <i>the idea of</i> its
absence to be both absent from a field of experience; in such case, we can still
suppose, as we indeed <i>see</i> as experience, that the thing itself is absent
(even though the idea of its absence is allegedly absent – until mentioned as
absent, that is!)</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[10]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">.
Thus, these laws are empirical, in the sense that they do not impose anything on
the phenomenon, but accept it as is. They merely push <i>the observer</i> back
into the fold of experience, should he venture to stray. They do not involve a
modification or manipulation of the phenomenon, but on the contrary make the
observer openly and carefully <i>attentive to</i> what is phenomenal. They
involve a distinction between primary phenomena (be they ‘material’ or
‘mental’), as given <i>ab initio</i>, and imaginary alleged representations
(ideas, mental phenomena) of eventual phenomena, which merely introduce
additional phenomena.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">It is very
important to emphasize again that <b><span style="color:navy">negation</span> is
a logical act</b>. It is never a pure experience, but always involves conceptual
interference by the Subject. In formal logic, terms like A and non-A are neutral
and formally indistinguishable. That is, they function in interchangeable ways,
so that the negation of non-A (non-non-A) is technically equivalent to A (by
obversion); and we might label non-A as ‘B’ and A as ‘non-B’ without
affecting inferential processes. But at the phenomenological level, these labels
are quite distinct. Something appearing would be labeled positively (say, A),
whereas something not-appearing would be labeled negatively (as non-A).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">What we here
labeled A is a phenomenon or percept. What we here labeled non-A is <i>not</i>
apparent per se, but only effectively ‘apparent’ in that <i>A</i> did not
appear. Non-A signifies that we have <i>asked a question</i> ‘is A there (i.e.
in the phenomenal field)?’ <i>and after further scrutiny answered it</i> by
‘no, I do not find it there’. The former (presence) is <i>directly</i>
known, the latter (absence) is <i>indirectly</i> known through a mental
projection (<i>imagining</i> A, i.e. inventing it or remembering it from
previous perceptions) coupled with an experimental search (whose result is
unsuccessful). Clearly these are very different cognitions – one being purely
passive and empirical, the other involving an active inquiry and referring to
observation only by the failure to confirm an anticipated equivalent of one’s
imagination. The later is useful and informative, but it is a construct.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Negative
concepts or statements are thus never strictly-speaking empirical, and negation
is a fundamental building block <i>of reason</i>. A negation is at the outset,
by its very <i>definition</i> when introduced by the Subject as a cognitive
artifice, logically contradictory to something. It cannot then be said <i>empirically</i>
that both percepts A and non-A occur (since saying I ‘see’ non-A in the
present field of perception just means I looked for and did not see A in it),
nor that neither A nor non-A occur (since if I look and do not see A in the
present field of perception, I would conclude non-A for it – though I may
remain open-minded about other eventual fields of perception containing A)</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[11]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">.
A negative concept or statement is therefore fundamentally different from a
positive one, and can at best only indirectly ever be characterized as
‘empirical’.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The three
laws of thought are logical primaries, involved in all discourse about any
phenomenon (and similarly relative to intuitive data, and at a later stage with
respect to conceptual discourse itself). They jointly operate in identical ways
in every observation, pushing us to admit what we see (identity), not to
contradict what we see (non-contradiction), and not to ignore and add
possibilities to what we see (exclusion of a middle). To fail to apply them is
simply to confuse the given data with additional mental ingredients (fantasies),
which neurotically either deny the evidence (mentally replacing it with its
contradiction) or question it (by mentally proposing a ‘middle’ term). These
laws can be stated as propositions, but they nevertheless have no conceivable
alternatives. Any doctrine proposed has to be reconciled with experience
somehow, since all discourse is a reaction to experience, an attempt to solve
the mystery it presents, so merely ignoring experience does not qualify as
reconciliation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">In that
sense, it is accurate to say that these laws are laws of thought; they are laws <i>for</i>
the mind (the observer). We may say that something is A and not A, or neither A
nor not-A. But these words have no meaning <i>in</i> experience, no phenomenal
referents. They are just words, sounds or drawings that signify nothing, not
even an imaginable circumstance. The way we ‘imagine’ them is to stupidly or
deliberately confuse a thing and an image of a thing, and project the idea of
non-A (instead of non-A itself) next to A (or next to the idea of A) or some
such artifice. In other words, the propositions claiming to deny the laws of
thought have only a superficial meaningfulness and credibility, due to in fact
having referents (ideas) <i>other than</i> those they pretend to have (things).
With regard to the original objects of perception, they are in fact silent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Note well
that application or obedience the laws of thought does not involve an
imaginative act (a volition); it is on the contrary attempts to ignore or deny
them which do, requiring interference of the observer’s imagination in the
cognitive process (preempting experience). That is, the laws of thought
themselves are objective, it is only their denials that are subjective (in the
pejorative sense). The laws of thought thus remain empirically, and
epistemically, and therefore epistemologically, undeniable. So much with regard
to applications of the laws of thought to perceptual evidence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">With regard
to concepts (which derive from comparisons and contrasts, or from subsequent
imaginations recombining such concepts) and propositions (imaginations of
relations between concepts), they remain always open to doubt, hypothetical, so
long as equally credible alternatives are imaginable. Credibility is found in
everything experienced or thought, it is merely admittance that such and such
has been experienced or thought (thought being a sort of experience, though
mental). <i>Ab initio</i>, any two concepts or propositions are <i>compatible</i>,
having both been thought. Incompatibility is a later judgment, which follows
realization that the concept or proposition somehow directly or indirectly
contradicts experiential evidence or leads to internal inconsistency in
knowledge or is inherently self-contradictory.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">If two such
ideas or thoughts are found or not found to be in utter conflict, they both
retain the minimal credibility of being at least <i>imaginable</i>, at least
till one or both of them is found incoherent with some experience(s) or for some
reason unimaginable. If for some reason they are considered to be in conflict,
they separately retain some credibility, though their interaction raises a doubt
and it is understood that we have to ultimately eliminate at least one of them,
removing its temporary credibility with reference to further experiences or
abstract considerations. During the phase of doubt, we may refer to their
frequencies of confirmation in experience, and regard one as more credible (or
likely or probable) than the other.</span></p>

symbols that conventionally refer to phenomena, intuitions and abstracts. As
sounds, sights, etc. per se, words are of course themselves phenomena, which can
be expressed either materially or mentally as outer or inner speech or writing,
being used for personal thought and memory or social communication and knowledge
accumulation. Many words have rich natural and historical roots, but they are
nonetheless conventional (i.e. arbitrarily chosen), in that they can always be
changed at will by consent. Also note, the equations between word-sounds and
word-sights (and likewise, felt-words) are also conventional</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[14]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Words
evidently differ from language to language, from one population group to
another. A language is a collection of words (vocabulary) used by someone or
some group, in accordance with certain accepted rules (grammar). Words, for old
or new things, are almost daily coined and adopted by individuals, social groups
and societies. Whoever coins a word, for whatever purpose, must <i>intend</i>
(chose, convene) some more or less stable signification for it. Without such an <i>intuitive</i>
understanding, words cannot have any semantic content.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Words are not
mere phenomena, but refer to things; i.e. these auditory, visual or touch
phenomena are signs for things (phenomena, intuitions and abstracts) other than
themselves. Whether the things they refer to are real or illusory, clear or
vague, is not logically relevant to the fact of signification. Signification is
a relation, one of equation of sorts, saying (i.e. intending, to repeat) ‘when
I mention this word, please think of this thing.’ Words are labels, they have
meaning. There are wordless thoughts; indeed most of thought is wordless. In the
case of wordless thought, one is conscious of the meaning without use of the
label.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Indeed, it is
ultimately impossible to understand, use or discuss words without appealing to
wordless thoughts. If (as some philosophers claim) words obtained their meanings
only by equations to other <i>words</i>, there would be need for an infinity of
words; and since that is not possible (language is limited in size, and anyway
man has no time for infinite regression), the most basic of words, from which
all others derive, would be meaningless; and thus <i>all</i> words would be
meaningless. But to claim (in words) that ‘words are all meaningless’ or
that ‘words refer only to other words’ is self-contradictory, since such
claim itself purports to have understandable and communicable meaning. Such
claim is thus not a consistent thesis, and can be rejected once and for all</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[15]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">.
Therefore, it is logically self-evident that some words are meaningful, and that
as well as words with explicit meanings, there are wordless implicit meanings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The meanings
of words, as we said, may be phenomenal objects (e.g. ‘Avi’ refers to an
individual physical person, but also ‘person’ refers to all persons),
intuitive objects (e.g. ‘I’ or ‘I want’) or abstract objects (e.g.
‘personhood’ or ‘wanting’). But moreover, more importantly, <b><i>every
word implies an intuition</i></b><i> </i>– the <b><span style="color:navy">intention</span></b>
that the word concerned be associated with such and such a meaning being itself
an intuitive object. We intend the meaning of a word, not only the first time,
when we coin it or learn it, but every time thereafter, whenever we use it.
Without such intention, the word remains a mere noise or shape, devoid of
meaning for us. Words in themselves are inert; it is our intentions that give
them life and power.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Each of us
knows (in the way of self-knowledge, intuition) what he means by the words he
uses at a given time, whether clearly or vaguely (and whether correctly or
erroneously according to previously accepted conventions). This is evident in
the fact that <i>when we think or communicate, we do not and do not need to
explicitly list out all the words in our language and map all their proposed
interrelations</i>; thus, our discourse at any given time is mostly wordless and
the words we do use at the time concerned must be admitted to be ultimately
wordlessly intended to refer to certain things, whatever they be.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">It is
therefore incontrovertible that we have self-knowledge of our intentions, with
regard to words at least – i.e. the fact of intuition is unavoidably implied
at least by the fact of language. This is an interesting and important <i>rational
proof of the existence and knowability of at least some intuitive objects </i>(objects
of self-knowledge), incidentally. We can confidently say that intuitive objects
exist, as any attempted discourse to deny them meaningfully itself logically
implies intentions (as to the meanings of the words used) and therefore (some)
intuitive objects. Thus, the postulate that there are intuitive objects is not
an arbitrary claim, but a hypothesis for which we have found empirical
(concrete) confirmation in the fact of language and its rational (abstract)
implications.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Putting our
ideas (terms, propositions, arguments) into words is called <b><span style="color:navy">verbalization</span></b>.
Regarding the meaningfulness of words, what misleads many skeptical philosophers
is the observation that words often have uncertain, vague and variable meanings.
Starting from the assumption that words have to have real, precise and
unchanging meanings to be at all meaningful, they conclude that words are
otherwise meaningless. But this is a mistaken view, based on the misapprehension
of word-meaning as equivalent to <i>definition</i> (by means of other words, as
above described) and on a model of knowledge as a closed-circuit and static body
of (verbal) information.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">In truth, as
careful observation of our actual behavior reveals, knowledge acquisition is
gradual and adaptive. Our experience is cumulative and our rational reaction to
it is a developing and evolving thing. There is no single item or total body of
knowledge that stands alone and final; and the interrelationships between items,
including the rules of interrelation, are always subject to review and revision.
Knowledge is inevitably <i>contextual</i>, implying an unending trial and error
process. It is not (verbal) definition that gives meaning to words; definition
is only <i>an attempt to put into words</i> and delineate what we <i>already</i>
wordlessly intend. A definition is like any other proposition subject to
empirical, intuitive and rational checks and balances. It is an inductive
product, not a deductive preliminary.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">When we come
across a new appearance (be it phenomenal, intuitive or abstract), we may find fit
to label ‘it’ for purposes of memory and further discourse. What we mean by
‘it’ (a physically, mentally, intuitively or verbally indicated, i.e. <i>pointed-to</i>,
object, a ‘this’) is always tentative and open-ended. As we proceed further,
thanks to new experiences and reasoning, this intended meaning may become firmer
or shift or even entirely dissolve. First, ‘it’ may seem clearly understood;
then we come across new phenomena or have new thoughts which make us realize
that the initial intention is uncertain or unclear and we have to adjust our
focus, and make further differentiations so as to pin-point more precisely what
we ‘really’ intended by it; and so on, successively. Sometimes the intention
remains unchanged, but our initial verbal definition (if any) may turn out to be
inaccurate (too broad or narrow or otherwise inappropriate) and require
modification. In some cases, we come to the conclusion that there was no need
for a new word, and either abandon it or accept it as a mere synonym. In some
cases, we realize that the term was already assigned to some other object, and
keep it mind that it is a homonym.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Words are
primarily intended to express (assumed) facts, but they may also be used –
inadvertently as well as consciously – to signify fictions. We are quite able
to distinguish a sensory phenomenon from an imaginary one without demonstrated
sensory equivalent, and register the names for each with appropriate caveats.
The intended object of a word may at first be thought real (as all appearances
tend to be), and then after further information and reflection (which sometimes
stretches over centuries), be found illusory. In such cases, the word may be
dropped altogether – or kept for historical or literary purposes <i>with the
understanding that </i>what it refers to is fictional (e.g. ‘unicorn’).
These observations in no way justify a general condemnation of verbalization,
but are events we take in stride without difficulty.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">‘<b><span style="color:navy">Universals</span></b>’
(a venerable philosophical term) is another word for abstracts, referring
firstly to the presumed something underlying identifications of distinct

and at a later stage to whatever may lie behind more complex products of
conception (involving imagination as well as logic); that is, all the
end-results of interpretation, of reasoning about the perceived outer and inner
world</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[17]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">.
Furthermore, we assume that there are also objects of intuition (i.e.
self-knowledge)</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[18]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">,
and these may also be compared and reasoned-about, and give rise to concepts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:35.4pt;text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">We
can safely assume that, in some cases at least, universals/abstracts/concepts
have an ontological significance, and are not merely mental constructs <i>referring
to nothing beyond themselves</i>. For to deny <i>all</i> concepts such reality,
is to deny truth and meaning to <i>one’s own</i> assertion too, since that
skeptical assertion itself is wholly composed of concepts. It follows that at
least <i>some</i> concepts must be admitted as having a presence independent of
any thought about them. (Precisely <i>which</i> concepts are to be admitted is
what the science of Logic is all about.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">As to the
nature of universals, my own theory (derived largely from modern physics and
Buddhist ideas) would be that universals are, effectively, mathematical
formulas. If I compare two waves, all the measurements I perform in doing so can
be expressed by means of the algebra of coordinate geometry</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[19]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">.
Such formulas, or rather<i> <b><span style="color:navy">the relative measures of
the waves’ features, motions and relations</span></b></i><b><span style="color:navy">
</span></b>signified/implied by the formulas, are what we call ‘universals.’</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><span lang="EN-US">If the waves making up two
particulars are wholly or partly equal or proportional, in respect of their
varying shapes and sizes (length, amplitude), positions, trajectories
(directions), speed, frequencies of conjunction or non-conjunction with others,
then the particulars seem are ‘similar’ to us, and their common measures can
be used to define concepts. Thus, universals (portions of waves, or of their
histories) can be found in two or more particulars (full waves); and further
abstracts can in turn be based on such abstracts (in the way of portions of
portions of waves).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The
magnitudes or degrees of the features, movements and interactions of waves
(universals) are not the waves themselves (particulars), yet <i>the waves cannot
exist without having measures</i>. We perceive the waves and we conceive the
formulas</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[20]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">,
but both are in a sense equally there, apparent in the phenomenal object of
experience. For this reason, even abstracts are sometimes regarded as quasi–
or virtually experienced (thus broadening the term ‘experience’ to cover all
appearances).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The waves and
their measures <i>cannot be dissociated</i> within the field of experience,
being respectively entities and attributes or behaviors of entities. What reason
does to ‘draw out’ (abstract) the measures, is to focus on them while
mentally ignoring the waves (or any images of or symbols for the waves). One
cannot normally directly know the measure of a <i>single</i> object; one can
only do so by considering and comparing a <i>plurality</i> of (two or more)
objects. Even when the intuited self conceives of ‘a self,’ although it has
no direct experience of other selves, it refers to the many times it has
intuited itself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, a universal can be said
to transcend experience, yet be somewhat in it or immanent – it straddles
experience. A universal is not in some metaphysical Platonic repository of
Ideas, nor merely in the mind of its beholders (though it may also be there,
when some external wave induces a like internal wave in a mind); it is inherent
in every complex of wave-forms with the selected common mathematical
characteristics.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">This
explanation is not intended as a mere metaphor– it need not be limited to
imagined waves, but can be extended to all concrete existents. If light and
gravity are waves, elementary particles are complicated bundles of such waves,
sound is a wave (movements of air masses), and if the other sense-modalities are
ultimately wave-like (as the electrochemical events associated to sensation
suggest), then all material and mental phenomena, including living beings, may
be said to be waves.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">These waves
all occur and travel and interact within a space and time as voluminous as the
universe, conceivably as moving deformations of some primordial fabric (the
stuff of ‘existence’)</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[21]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">.
They vary in complexity, ranging from brief and short events (unit waves, say)
to the 3-D pulsations of quarks, photons, neutrinos, electrons or atoms,
molecules, and to larger and larger collective wave motions of the later. Not
just sights and sounds, but all sense-modalities, material or mental, including
whole living organisms, are in this view varieties of wave or wave-motion
formations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">And perhaps
not only objective phenomena, but also subjective (i.e. intuited in/by the
Subject) things and events might be supposed to have this fundamental wave
character.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Wherever
waves (particulars) appear, their measures (abstracts) are inherent in them. So
we can say that, although universals are not normally additional <i>extensions</i>
in the experiential field (i.e. not themselves discernible wave events), they
are still somehow present in it. They are normally only known through
interpretative efforts (comparing and contrasting two or more waves). This
theory of universals as mere measures of things assumes all things are reducible
to wave activity (in some primordial substratum, perhaps – yet not an ether,
somehow</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[22]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">In that case,
the complex waves we call the <b><span style="color:navy">sensations</span></b>
can well be construed as wave signals transmitted from one end of the sense
organs via the spine and/or brain</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[23]</span></a><span lang="EN-US">
over to their other end where the observer observes them. Similarly, <b><span style="color:navy">memories</span></b>
may be supposed to be wave signals stored and sustained within the brain for
occasional recall. That is, the senses transmit energy or fields onward to the
Subject, from the ‘outer’ region of his experience, comprising his apparent
body and its material surrounds. Memory may thereafter be produced,
reverberating with the same vibration.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">With this
thesis, we are not forced to assume that the waves are distorted in transmission
or storage, since our premise is that the terminal wave is a continuation of the
initial wave. In such case, the message received (by the observer) does not just
<i>resemble</i> the original message (captured by the sense organ’s receptors
or stored in memory); it <i>is</i> the original message, which has vibrated
through the senses, and possibly memory, to us without refraction. Assuming
uniformity, the beginning and end waves are just the same object at a different
time – a single traveling (wave) object. They may be of different <i>substance</i>
(material, in whatever way, or even a mental product of material waves) and even
magnitude (though with due proportions), but their <i>form</i> must remain the
same. The universal is that form – the mathematical characteristics (including
motions and interactions, as well as features) of the wave.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:35.4pt;text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Thus,
when I see or remember a bird, say, I can rightly consider that I am in <i>direct</i>
contact with the bird; I am experiencing the waves emitted by the bird that
reach over (via the senses, or memory) all the way to me the observer. The waves
<i>are</i> the bird, the part of it that flows over into my body. This is not a
mystical statement, but one quite physical. Any delimitation of the bird (or any
object) in space and time elsewhere than at the very limits of its range of
physical effects is arbitrary.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman" lang="EN-US" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[24]</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">We should
also in this context account for another kind of filtering, that of perceptible
objects we do not care or take care to perceive. Thus, for example, I ordinarily
do not pay attention to the glasses I am wearing or to the chair I am sitting
on, and a mass of other sensations. I do not think such uninteresting items are
ignored by the sense organs, because then we would not have the choice of
perceiving them on occasion. Rather, I think we perceive them faintly, but
discard the message, or allow it to enter memory subliminally, without giving it
full conscious attention.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Similar
comments can be made with regard to memory, note well. Once the sense-object has
been perceived by the Subject, after relaying the waves concerned by sensory
processes, the wave is stored (electrochemically, as neuroscientists teach us)
in the brain. That is, we can well suppose, the wave <i>itself</i> is
artificially made to <i>continue existing</i> in the way of some activity in the
brain. Thus, in this view, the neurological ‘imprint’ is not a mere coded <i>symbol
of </i>the original message, it <i>is</i> the original mathematical message. In
such case, even while admitting that the message may occasionally be dampened,
hard to recall or even lost, there is no need to figure out how come it
(usually) stays the same. When we evoke a memory, or recognize a repetition of a
sense-object previously encountered, we merely use the <i>ongoing</i> physical
wave deep in the brain to produce a perceptible mental wave, identical in form
to the stored one and to its sensory origin, projecting it (as an more or less
vivid image) apparently inside our mind (for reminiscence) or outside it (for
comparison to the new sense-object).</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">What is true
of memory of sensations is equally applicable to memory of abstracts based on
such sensations, since as above postulated such abstracts are merely
mathematical aspects of the wave-forms of the original sensations. Thus, we can
understand without difficulty how abstracts are concretely stored in memory. As
for mental projections (imaginations, perhaps feelings) and objects of
intuition, and abstracts derived from them, supposedly they have allied physical
vibrations in the brain (i.e. each of those thoughts has a specific physical
effect, which therefore ‘corresponds’ to it), which may be stored in memory
and recalled.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0cm"><span lang="EN-US">Some
philosophers would object that the waves sensed or remembered may well, for all
we know, change form as they tumble through the sense-channels, or within their
memory storage. But in such case, we still have to appeal to the senses and
memory to invalidate particular sensory or memory experiences – otherwise, how
do we claim to know that error occurred? So we can only logically suppose
occasional distortion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><span lang="EN-US">They could instead argue that
the waves we experience are not as they seem end products of sensory processes,
but independent events merely contiguous with them. But in such case, the
impressions that we have a body, with a brain, spine and sense organs boiling
with activity, would remain unexplained phenomena, leaving a gap or loose end in
our understanding of the world experienced. To integrate all phenomena into our
world-view, we need to include consideration of the phenomena we call the sense
organs, etc., and suggest why they are there, what their role might be in the
wider context of experience.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0cm"><span lang="EN-US">Thus,
extreme skepticism is self-defeating, whether by inconsistency or by
incompleteness. At first sight, the sensory and memory processes might be
supposed refractive, producing an image very different from its origin</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

We however cannot logically claim that this is definitely true, because such
statement would require cognition of sense-objects without reliance on the
senses, or of memory-objects without reliance on memory. The critic would be
claiming special cognitive privileges not granted to the rest of us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0cm"><span lang="EN-US">Our
present account approaches the issues from another angle – phenomenologically.
Start with the phenomenon <i>as a whole</i> as given; the only issue at stake is
then: what is the possible relation between these two aspects of it (the objects
classed as external and those classed as mental-images produced by the senses or
the brain)? In that case, we may assume that the senses and memory relay the
information and do so without affecting it, with much less pretensions. For we
only claim to <i>relate together </i>two factors (the material object allegedly
sensed or remembered, and the subsequent sensory or memory processes presenting
a mental image at the interface with the observer) which are <i>already</i> in
the field of consciousness and accepted as existing (whereas the opposite view
lays claim to things <i>outside</i> its own awareness by its own admission).</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0cm"><span lang="EN-US">We are
only attempting to explain the existing situation, that a process takes place
through the senses during perception of physical matter or in the brain during
its recognition – what is the role of these evident processes, we ask? If we
assume there is <i>always</i> refraction, we are making a statement denying our
experience of the matter at hand. But we may well, i.e. consistently, assume
that <i>not all</i> sense or memory information is faithfully transmitted, so
long as we can determine the matter by <i>some</i> other, more reliable
sense-data (and, often, of memory-data). We thus prove that (some) sense and
memory data is trustworthy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">We may wish
to confirm sense evidence scientifically, by means of experiments showing that
the information indeed stays the same from reception by the senses to
presentation to the observer, in the way of a physically discernible persistent
vibration, whatever its comparative size, depth or substance. Similarly, we
could look for an ongoing physical vibration of some sort in the brain, before
definitively concluding that memory is stocked as specific wave-forms. But the
issue is really not empirical – it is logical (which means in practice that
even if we don’t immediately find something, we have to keep looking).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Say we find
no evidence of persistent wave-forms; we would alternatively look for fixed
formulas that ‘translate’ the original wave in some regular manner, so that
even if the final wave does not resemble it they can be correlated. Claiming
codification of sense or memory data is not the same as claiming lawless
refraction; for uniform refractive processes would simply require that we
‘correct’ our world-view by ‘translation’, whereas random refraction
(such that no correspondences whatever can be established) would leave us in
confusion. But in the last analysis, even assumption of a regular code is not a
viable theory, because it too ultimately makes contradictory claims, that matter
is perceived and yet – because of sense or brain interference – is not
perceived correctly (which means, not perceived period).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">So we must
conclude, whatever experiment reveals, that ‘some sense and memory experience
is valid’ is a logical truth. That is, no experiment being possible without
this truth, none can belie it!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:35.4pt;text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">We
do not need an epistemological ‘axiom’ to defend sensation and memory as
universally reliable. It suffices to consider the products of these faculties as
<i>true until and unless found false</i>. That is, the assumption of their
essential correctness is an <i>inductive</i> principle, rather that a deductive
credo. No artificial forcing of the issue is involved. Every event of sensation
or memory is granted initial credibility, while remaining open to eventual
sensations or memories that may put the preceding in doubt. When and if
particular contradictions occur, they must be sorted out in accordance with
normal logic.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">It should be
noted that the wave theory of universals proposed is the only coherent theory
available. If we consider other proposals in the history of philosophy, we find
them all to be logically flawed, and so in fact incapable of dealing adequately
with the problem of universals. Thus, Plato’s Idealism, according to which the
explanation of the common characters of different things experienced in our
world are that they reflect certain transcendental “Ideas,” gives a wrong
impression of solving the problem while in fact only sweeping it under the
carpet. The Ideas existing in a higher world are only <i>less numerous</i> than
the things in our lower world, but they are still a plurality with some common
characters. In that case, what of <i>their</i> common characters, such as
“transcendentalism,” “ideality,” or existence – are they in turn
representatives of a single, unitary, top world? And how would this One Grand
Idea break down into the Lesser Ideas?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">A more
immanent view of universals, which could be regarded as effectively the current
“common-sense” view, would be that different primary <i>substances</i> are
scattered throughout the universe and combine in different ways to produce the
things we perceive through the senses. Alternative theories can be proposed as
to what to regard as these material substances: they might be distinct <i>sensa</i>
(i.e. units of sensed light, sound, etc.), or perhaps <i>qualities</i> (the
minimum number required to construct things) rationally inferred from sense
data. Some suggest instead that universals may be <i>mental</i> or <i>verbal</i>
constructs – i.e. imaginations or subjective inventions or mere words in our
heads. Whatever we construe them to be, the (material or mental) theories of
universals as substances suffer from the same flaw as Plato’s theory: we are
still left with the need to explain a plurality (albeit a smaller one), and
derive it from a unity (existence).</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US"><a name="5. Unity In Plurality">5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">
</span>Unity In Plurality</a></span></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="tab-stops:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">The above
‘wave’ theory of universals, <i>granting</i> its premise that everything is
ultimately reducible to ‘waves,’ i.e. mobile vibrations in some sort of
continuum, leads to the very radical conclusion that ‘all things are one.’</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The world as
it appears to our touch-organs or to the naked eye – or even the eye aided by
microscope or telescope – may give the impression that dimensionless points,
lines or surfaces exist in nature, but as Physics has evolved it has become
clearer that <b><i>physical objects do not have precise corners, sides or
facades – but fuzzy limits, arbitrarily defined </i></b>by the visibility to
our senses (specifically, sight and touch), aided or unaided, of concentrations
of matter or energy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><span lang="EN-US">For example, the tip of my
penknife may seem like a sharp “point” to my touch or sight, but it is
really – according to physical science (i.e. upon further investigation and
reflection) – a rough, voluminous conglomerate of atoms, which are themselves
complexes of smaller and smaller particles (electrons, protons and neutrons,
seemingly some distance ‘apart’ from each other, etc.), which are themselves
without beginning or end being really vague clusters of waves. Similarly with
regard to the cutting edge or flat sides of my penknife.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Indeed, if
one takes these considerations to their extreme conclusion, one could say that <b><i>no
object has a beginning or end, every object stretches to the ends of the
universe or to infinity</i></b>, and what we refer to as a specific individual
object is merely the most humanly visible or concentrated part of that whole,
which we arbitrarily or conventionally consider a separable unit (and habitually
name, to solidify our viewpoint). So that <b><i>ultimately, there are in fact no
individual objects, but only ripples in the single object that is the universe
as a whole</i></b>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Where does an
atom (or any other body) begin or end, granting that all consists of waves? If
we see a star billions of miles away, on what basis do we say that the star ends
over there, while the “light from the star” is here? Rather, we ought to say
that the light we see is <i>part of</i> the star, i.e. that it extends all the
way to us (at and through our visual sense organs, and on to our memory) and
beyond. At what distance from the star do the gases or the light it emits cease
to ‘belong’ to it, and are to be considered as ‘separate’ bodies? <b><i>The
cut-off point can only be arbitrary, i.e. mere convention. </i></b>Gravity
operates at astronomical distances. What objective ground do we have for
distinguishing a field from its apparent origin? Furthermore, stars are in
constant flux, arising in time and disappearing in time. At what point in time
(as well as space) may we claim that the matter and energy we now call a star is
‘not yet’ or ‘no longer’ a star? Surely, the quarks from which the star
emerged were already ‘the star’ and when the star bursts or is absorbed into
a black hole it is still ‘the star.’ We ourselves are stardust – does that
mean that the stars in question <i>became</i> us, or that <i>being</i> a star
– from the beginning of time to its end – includes eventual human forms?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">In this view,
<b><i>every entity in the universe stretches out with every other to fill the
whole space and time of the universe</i></b>! And if we say this, we might as
well say<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>– without any mystical
intent, though in agreement with Buddhist mystics – that all things are one.
There are just <i>more intense concentrations</i> of matter or energy here and
there, now and then, in <i>one continuous</i> field, but nowhere dividing lines.
Because <b><i>we perceive only fractions of the totality, only the aspects
involving the sense-modalities</i></b>, we isolate small blobs of the whole as
individual phenomena. All phenomena perceived are centers of complex wave
activities in the universal fabric; <i>We</i> ‘individuate’ phenomena <i>with
reference to the sense-modalities they exhibit which are accessible to our
senses</i>. We regard as delimiting an individual object in space and time such
perceivable <i>fraction</i> (visible to the senses) of the wave activity
stretching to the ends of the universe – ignoring its larger invisible
extensions, later induced by reason. Thus, <b><i>all individuation is fantasy </i></b>(this
can be known by rational considerations, as here), <b><i>reinforced by naming</i></b>
(itself a sense-modality phenomenon, by the way). In which case, strictly
speaking,<i> <b>nothing is divisible at all</b></i>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">That would seem to be a correct view
of our physical world in the context of present knowledge – the hypothesis
most consistent with experience, experiment and current scientific theorizing.
We thus, provided we anticipate the results of Physics and claim that some sort
of unified field theory is sure to be established, and provided we stretch that
assumption to include wave explanations of the mental and spiritual domains,
arrive at a concept of the world as ‘unity in plurality’ – a harmonious
marriage of the philosophies of Pluralism and Monism. Heraclitus was right –
everything is ultimately motion (i.e. waves) and Parmenides was right too –
everything is ultimately one thing (i.e. the medium subject to waves).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">We could even
view this conclusion as a justification of the Buddhist view that “all things
are empty!” For instance, the message of <i>The Diamond Sutra </i>seems to be
that all objects material or spiritual are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">infinite</i>
vortices with no beginning and no end. They are neither categorical as they
seem; nor can they be surely declared hypothetical, being delimited merely by
our naming of them, but having no sure limits in themselves so far as we know so
that they are therefore effectively boundless.</span></p>
<span lang="EN-US">We have already, inspired by Buddhist doctrine, concurred
with them that individuation is a man-made artifice. But even granting that we might legitimately, out of mere convenience,
focus on specific places and durations of the universe, because a disturbance
‘stands-out’ there and then in relation to our senses – we are still left
with the question as to <i>what</i> it is that is disturbed? What is <i>the
medium</i> or substratum of all wave motions? We are tempted to view it as a
stuff and call it “existence,” or like Descartes call it “the ether.”
The problem is that since the Michelson-Morley experiment on the velocity of
light such a substance underlying waves has apparently been discredited. These
physicists measured the velocity of light in the same direction as our
planet’s motion and in the opposite direction. To everyone’s surprise, they
found the velocity identical either way. This was eventually explained by Albert
Einstein as indicative that there is no absolutely stationary substratum or
“ether” relative to which wave motions occur, and he built his famous theory
of Relativity as an alternative world-view (such that space and time coordinates
are depend on the velocity of the observer relative to what he measures).</span>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Thus, although when we think of waves,
and mathematically work out their motions and interactions, we regard them as
disturbances within some medium, it turns out that there is no such medium
according to experimental indices! On this basis, we can agree with Buddhist
philosophers that (surprisingly, incomprehensibly) <i>nothing</i> is being waved
– i.e. that the ultimate nature of “existence” is “emptiness.” And
there is no need of high meditation or mystical insight to arrive at this
conclusion – it is seemingly justified by ordinary experience and reason
(scientific experiment and theory).&nbsp;<o:p>

    Thus, the sense of depth in the surrounding material world is not only due
    to perceptions and conceptions of perspective, but also to various sound and
    touch sensations, which add body to visual depth. The sounds or smells we
    experience have direction, with reference to movements of their external

    location and shape/size and texture in our mouths and tongues, a hardness or

    </span>Of course, at a conceptual level, i.e. when dealing with abstracts,
    we may encounter contradictions (i.e. both A and non-A seeming true) and
    doubts (i.e. neither A nor non-A seeming true). Here, both the positive and
    negative concepts are mental constructs, and so there is no guarantee that
    the issue can immediately be resolved by one look. That is of course where
    the whole science of logic comes into play; it is needed to deal with just
    such issues with reference to a plurality of experiences.</span></p>

    </span>We consider concepts or propositions compatible until and unless we
    find some incompatibility between them. As I already pointed out in <i>Future
    Logic</i>, in opposition to the claims of certain modern logicians, we do
    not ‘prove consistency’ but rather ‘find inconsistencies’.</span></p>

    </span>Thus, e.g. the sound of ‘Avi’ and the written letters A-v-i have
    no relation other than what we have convened for them, though that
    convention has a rich history that we will not needlessly ignore.</span></p>

    </span>Similarly, the claim that words are mere conventions implies that
    ‘knowledge is conventional’ is confused. First because that proposition,
    as a factual assertion, claims to know something beyond convention about
    knowledge; whereas applied to itself, it denies the possibility of
    non-conventional knowledge. But furthermore, all conventions imply factual
    knowledge: you have to know <i>that</i> there is a convention and <i>what</i>
    that convention is supposed to be and <i>how</i> to apply it correctly! You
    cannot have a convention about a convention… <i>ad infinitum</i> – it
    has to stop somewhere factual.</span></p>

    </span>Comparison involves two objects, as already stated. This does not
    mean that comparison is impossible with only one extended object under
    scrutiny, for we may be able to compare <i>parts</i> of that object
    together. We may, for instance, compare the sides and corners of a single
    square: the resulting concept is not the square figure as such, but concerns
    more specifically lines and angles. Even then, the concept is incomplete
    till we contrast other lines and angles.</span></p>

    </span>I here count identification of sameness and difference in concretes,
    and of their conformity with the ‘laws of thought’, as among acts of
    reason (the first and simplest of them) in that they result in conceptual
    information. They are however so basic and relatively brief and devoid of
    process (direct) that they seem akin to perceptions. We could also, and
    often do, regard them as a distinct class of objects – objects of
    conceptual <i>insight</i>, as against ‘conceptualization’.</span></p>

    </span>I have note well excluded from this class, of objects of intuition,
    claims to direct knowledge of objects beyond oneself, e.g. claims to sensing
    ghosts or reading other people’s thoughts. These claims must be regarded, <i>ab
    initio</i> at least, as pretentious. While it might eventually be
    demonstrated by experiment that some people do have such extrasensory
    cognitive powers in some circumstances (e.g. by finding what they predict as
    thought by others as reported always or usually true by the latter, although
    no physical means of communication between the two were possible), the need
    for careful demonstration remains in every case an epistemological
    necessity. We cannot naïvely accept such claims as valid without resulting
    chaos in knowledge; they must be viewed as <i>hypotheses to be confirmed by
    adductive means</i>. Most people who claim direct knowledge of spiritual,
    intuitive, mental or material events outside themselves are simply not aware
    of the inductive processes involved in thinking, and tend to take their
    first impressions for granted without verification procedures.</span></p>

    </span>I do not mean to say that every time we think a universal we
    construct a precise mathematical formula. Ordinarily, people rarely if ever
    revert to advanced mathematics! I merely imply that we tend to such a
    formula, in a vague and approximate way – i.e. that if the mass of mental
    measurements and comparisons in our minds were correctly summarized, they
    would amount to a certain formula. Ex post facto extrapolation from
    fragmentary observations and notes is thus involved, in speaking of a
    formula.</span></p>

    </span>Looking at a large body of water such as a lake, you can get a visual
    image or analogy of what a universe of waves would be. You see bubbles,
    ripples and waves in constant flux, appearing, moving around, disappearing;
    these seem individual, in that the sunlight allows us to mentally draw
    boundaries for them, but they are all just the movements of one big entity;
    stir one place in the lake, and the motion is carried over to many or
    eventually (in diminishing degrees) all others.</span></p>

    </span>A bird, of course, is a complex entity, involving not only light
    waves from its plumage, but other sense data, like its physiology, its
    movements and behavior patterns, its call, its smell, even its taste. It is
    through consideration of <i>all</i> information about a given bird, in the
    same and other sense-modalities, and its comparison to other birds and
    things, that we decide whether, say, a visual message (apparent bird-form)
    falls in the category of ‘real’ bird, or is merely a photograph or
    statue of a bird. Errors do occur, not because the visual message is ever
    wrong, but due to not taking into consideration all information currently

    </span>Although I say wave-form, I do not mean that sense-perception is
    perception of ‘universals’. The wave the observer sees (via the sense
    organ concerned) is still concrete; it is not merely the <i>measurement</i>
    of the original wave (a ‘universal’ or formula or abstract) that is
    passed on, but the wave itself or a continuing echo of it (a concrete
    manifestation). I only mean to remind that the wave <i>has</i> a form,
    indeed a constant one.</span></p>

    </span>This idea suggests that memory too is specific to the different
    sense-modalities; but it might also involve many sense modalities at once.
    As imagination is based on memory, it would be economical to store memories
    of complex sensory events in the various sense-modalities, so that they can
    be accessed separately in new combinations.</span></p>

    </span>I cannot at this stage say just why filtering is necessary, however.
    A plausible explanation would be that a direct universal consciousness would
    be overwhelming somehow, driving the observer crazy by the multiplicity of
    messages. For evidently, digesting data <i>takes time</i>, we have to ponder
    the interrelationships between the items of our experience, and indeed think
    about the validity of our thinking processes. We all know from bitter
    experience that if too much information and thought is required at any
    moment, we become confused. The sense-filters therefore probably help us to
    sort and order incoming data for analysis and synthesis. Yet immediate
    universal consciousness is precisely what Enlightenment-seekers work for and
    claim possible. According to them, reliance on sense-perceptions is an
    aberration to be avoided, sense-data being but a veil over reality!</span></p>

    </span><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>Such filtering may be considered not to occur in self-knowledge –
    there being no distance to travel between the observer and himself, or
    disturbances within himself (viewing here attitudes and volitions as waves
    or wave motions, perhaps within some distinct, ‘spiritual’ substance of
    the observer’s soul), no senses are needed and the observer knows himself
    most directly.</span></p>

    </span>The best metaphor for memory, in my view, is that of an <i>echo
    chamber</i>. I imagine a sight or sound (or whatever) channeled into a brain
    cell and there allowed to rotate on and on (storage function), until we
    decide to peek into the cell and see or hear the vibration once more (recall
    function).</span></p>

    </span>Note in passing that this skeptical thesis at least implicitly admits
    that internal objects (images) are correctly perceived by the Subject
    (within his mind), even if it claims them to be incorrect renditions of
    external objects by the sensory and brain organs. It has to do so, to have
    anything to discuss at all! Cognition as such is not in question, but only
    the assumed equation between different classes of objects.</span></p>
