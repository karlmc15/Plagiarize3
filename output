type of classification complexity of the used method number of processed by the used method structural singular paired superficial description the metrics is computed without any knowledge of the linguistic rules or a document structure
synonyms consistent people usually try to hide their activity and replace words by suitable synonyms in order to break up the continuous copied sentences
documents phrase singular vectorssingular valuesdocument singular vectors m = u × σ × vt p h r a s e s figure
some modern approaches from the other fields of nature language processing give us new possibilities to modification and improving the current plagiarism detection methods
the main idea of this protection rests in psychology because every plagiarized document can be easily identified when compared to the database
the occurrence of the phrases created in the previous step is placed into matrix m. then it is decomposed into three matrices u
∑ and v. the last step analyses the decomposed matrices in order to receive an evaluation of the most similar documents
classification of free text copy detection methods multi-dimensional corpal almost all current free text or source code copy detection systems are paired
which can be easily modified so that it could accept punctuation and would prevent creating phrases across two different sentences
several singular metrics can be employed to calculate how similar the documents are.two documents are processed together to compute the metrics
